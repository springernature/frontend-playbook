# Browser Caching

## HTML Markup

* Serve these with a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header. This will instruct the browser to cache locally but only after checking with the server that the content hasn’t changed. Note that `no-cache` does NOT mean "don’t cache", rather it tells the browser to always revalidate when the resource is requested. `no-store` tells the browser not to cache at all, which isn’t usually desirable.
* See [Caching best practices](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/) for more information.

## CSS, JS and Images

* Set a long `max-age` eg: `Cache-Control: max-age: 31536000` (one year). The `max-age` directive states the maximum amount of time in seconds that fetched responses are allowed to be used again (from the time when a request is made) and because content on these URLs typically don't change, it is safe to cache them for really long periods.
* Use a [cache-busting](https://www.keycdn.com/support/what-is-cache-busting) mechanism for versioning assets to ensure that the browser caches each version as a different URL. Example: `sncss-29d48c7.css` or `sncss.js?v=29d48c7` where “_29d48c7_” is an auto-generated number unique to every version of the file. Frameworks like [Shunter](https://github.com/springernature/shunter) use the filename version style which is preferred.

## General

* If it is under your control, ensure the server provides an Entity Tag (`ETag`) header. The `ETag` header is an additional identifier for a specific version of a resource, typically comprised of the modified time and file size. (On older systems the ETag may also include an inode portion, but this is problematic.) The `Etag` header is especially useful to prevent simultaneous updates overwriting each other. If you use a CDN, it is likely this header will already be provided and properly configured. Learn more:

    * [Express options for 'ETag' setting](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#etag.options.table)
* You no longer need to use [`Expires` headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expires) as it has been superseded by `Cache-Control` header with `max-age`, which is [supported by modern browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Browser_compatibility).

It’s important to note that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to caching, so always decide a caching strategy based on your needs.
