# Performance

Performance refers to the speed in which web pages are downloaded and displayed on the user's browser.

Faster page speeds have been shown to increase visitor retention and user satisfaction, especially for users with slow internet connections and those on mobile devices. Improved web performance also leads to less data travelling across the web, which in turn lowers a website's power consumption and environmental impact.
