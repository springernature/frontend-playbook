# Constraints

The following document details the reasons why we do some of the things we do.

## Our constraints

As part of a big company that delivers scientific content, there are some constraints that define the work that we do.

Particularly, the solutions that we deliver:

* must be accessible,
* must be Technically Robust and Performant,
* must be Legally Robust,
* will reflect Management & Org Structure,
* are bound by our Infrastructure,
* need to be appropriately Secure, 
* need to reflect the Company's Stature, and
* need to endure over a long-period of time.

As a result of these constraints, the solutions that we provide are:

* [Progressively enhanced](../practices/house-style.md#progressive-enhancement-and-browser-support)
* Compliant with [WCAG 2.0 level AA](../practices/house-style.md#ccessibility)
