# Data protection considerations

Development of products at Springer Nature must comply with data protection regulations and practices established by the business, based on the legal frameworks of the countries in which we operate.

This is achieved by:

- Ensuring that products are created with care and respect for user data:
  - User data MUST be collected only when strictly necessary and/or when the user has given informed consent.
  - Users MUST be informed of what data is being collected and why through the use of mechanisms like Privacy Policy pages.
  - User data MUST only be shared with third parties for legitimate business or legal purposes.
- Ensuring that the frontend we create follows secure practices as outlined in [our security guidelines](../security/README.md).

This ensures that:

- Our products comply with international data protection laws, such as the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and the [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act).
- We retain user trust.
