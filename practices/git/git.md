## Repositories

We use a standard naming format for our Git repositories. Repository names are _lowercase-hyphenated_ (all lowercase, words separated by a hyphen), and begin with "frontend" followed by your project name.

We _don't_ do this:

```
front-end-project-name
front-end-projectname
project-name-front-end
project-name-frontend
```

We do this:

```
frontend-project-name
```


## Commit Messages

Your commit messages are your personal legacy.

They are the record of what you've done to a codebase and more importantly, *why*.

* Make the first line [50 characters or less](http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/), followed by a blank line.
* Add more explanatory text if necessary, as detailed as you need. But please make lines wrap at 72 characters.
* If the work was done in relation to a ticket, include the ticket number in the commit message. **DON'T** only use the ticket number â€” this just makes life hard for your colleagues to understand what the change was for. The git log should be all they need to read.
* Unhelpful messages like "Update" or "Bugfix" are... _unhelpful_. Please explain a little more.

One useful tip for writing great commit messages: imagine your commit message has to make sense prefaced with _"If applied, this commit will..."_.

## Versioning

Our open source projects are versioned with [semver](semver.md). Check our [Open Source support](../open-source-support.md) guide for details on how to version and release an update to an open source project.
