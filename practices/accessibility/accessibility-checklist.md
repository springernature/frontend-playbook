# A simple accessibility checklist

This checklist is a synthesis of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1], the [WCAG Samurai Errata], and one guideline from [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2].

It has proven helpful when building sites that comply with [US Section 508] and the [UK Equality Act 2010] \(all of our sites must comply with these pieces of legislation).

Be sure to create an issue or submit a pull request if you have any questions, or have spotted any improvements that can be made.

1. **Where meaning would be lost if a non-text item were removed, has a text alternative been provided?**  
   [Samurai errata (guideline 1)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL1)

1. **Are audio and video accessible?**  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 1, sound)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#sound)  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 1, video)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#video)

1. **For actual content (in most cases, that means text), have confusable colours been avoided?**  
   For example, do not set light green text on a pink background.  
   There is no limitation on using confusable colours as design elements, nor is there a limitation on displaying areas of confusable colours next to each other (e.g., green type on a white background can sit alongside a solid red rectangle).  
   See this page about [effective colour contrast](effective-colour-contrast.md).

1. **Has colour been avoided as a sole method of indicating an item on a page, either in its markup or style or via reference?**  
   For example, do not return a form with errors indicated solely in red; use additional markup, like strong, and/or use additional text like an asterisk or a visual icon with text equivalent, and/or explain in words what the errors are and where they are located.
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 2)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL2)

1. **Does text have a contrast ratio which makes it perceivable by people with colour blindness?**  
   The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:

   * Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
   * Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
   * Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

   [WCAG 2 (guideline 1.4.3)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast)

1. **Is the natural language of a page's text and any text equivalents (e.g., captions), identified through use of the lang attribute?**  
   For example: Identify the primary language of a document &ndash; preferably on the html tag, through use of the html lang attribute (or xml:lang attribute for xhtml). Where other languages are embedded within a document, an html lang attribute must be used (on an enclosing element) to indicate this.
   [Samurai errata (guideline 4)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL4)

1. **Have documents been organized so they may be read without style sheets?**  
   For example, when an HTML document is rendered without associated style sheets, it must still be possible to read the document.
   [WCAG 1, guideline 6.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-order-style-sheets)

1. **Does the page transform gracefully?**  
   For example: Do not provide alternative presentations or alternate pages. Make the original page accessible. In particular, this requires you to use JavaScript or other scripting in a way that is intrinsically accessible. You are not required to create a single page that works exactly the same with and without scripting, nor should you create one page with scripting and another without it.  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 6)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL6)

1. **Does the user have control of time-sensitive content changes?**  
   For example, do not cause flickering, flashing, or blinking. Advertisements, including advertisements served by a third party on a page you control, are covered by this guideline. They too may not cause flickering, flashing, or blinking.  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 7)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL7)

1. **Are embedded elements of the interface accessible?**  
   For example: are programmatic elements such as scripts directly accessible? Are they device independent? Are they keyboard operable?  
   [WCAG 1, guideline 8](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#gl-own-interface)

1. **Has the page been designed for device-independence? E.g. is it keyboard accessible?**  
   For example: do not use server side image maps, do not use tabindex, do not use accesskey.  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 9)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL9)  
   Also see [WCAG 1 glossary: "device independent"](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#device-independent)

1. **Are tables used appropriately?**  
   I.e. do data tables transform gracefully, and are layout tables absent?  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 9)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL5)

1. **Have interim solutions been used?**  
   For example: 
   * have pop-ups been avoided? 
   * If form placeholder text is used, is it done in an accessible way (e.g. using HTML5 placeholder attribute)? 
   * If opening a hyperlink in a new window cannot be avoided, has an advanced warning been provided? Does the link have a visible marker indicating its behaviour? 
      * Is that marker also accessible to screenreaders?

1. **Does the page Use W3C technologies and guidelines?**  
   For example: HTML for content, CSS for presentation.  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 11)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL11)

1. **Has context and orientation information been provided?**  
   For example: have labels been explicitly associated with their controls?  
   Have large blocks of information been divided into groups, for example using fieldset, optgroup, nested lists, and headings?  
   [Samurai Errata (guideline 12)](http://www.wcagsamurai.org/erratas/errata-listing/#GL12)  
   Also see [WCAG guideline 12.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-group-information) and [WCAG guideline 12.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-associate-labels)

1. **Are there clear navigation mechanisms?**  
   For example: have "click here" type links been avoided? Are navigation mechanisms consistent? Has metadata been provided (e.g. microformats)? Is there a sitemap?  
   [WCAG guideline 13](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#gl-facilitate-navigation)

1. **Are documents clear and simple?**  
   For example: Has the clearest and simplest language been used for the page's content? Have graphic or auditory presentations been used (where they will facilitate comprehension)? Is there a style of presentation that is consistent across pages?  
   [WCAG 1, guideline 14](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#gl-facilitate-comprehension)
