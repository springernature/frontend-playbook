These guidelines are based on ethical, [accessibility](accessibility/accessibility.md) and performance recommendations and best practices.


## Ethical

* Do use clear, intelligible, and unambiguous information.
* Don't use ads that are misleading. For example, "trick banners" that look like part of the operating system UI.
* Don't use ads that advertise businesses that participate in spammy or scammy practices.
* Don't use images that convey a false sense of urgency.
* Don't advertise products with obvious exaggerations or dubious claims that are impossible to prove.
* Don't advertise "free" products or services that have hidden costs or charges.
* Don't advertise gambling, alcohol and tobacco.
* Don't use [pop-under ads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_ad#Pop-under_ads).
* Adverts must not contain spyware, malware or any software that results in an unexpected or deceptive experience. This includes links to sites containing these products.


## Accessibility

* Don't use ads that make use of fast animations or flashing content.
* The ad content must have clearly defined borders and not be confused with normal page content.
* Audio or video in ads must be user initiated. A control must be included in order to allow for audio/video initiation and stop.

All advertising must also comply with the rest of our [accessibility guidelines](accessibility/accessibility-checklist.md).


## Performance

* Do load ads asynchronously.
* Don't use ads that add a significant size to the page.
* Do use a maximum of 15 file requests for initial file load, as per the [IAB display advertising guidelines](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-display-advertising-guidelines/).
* All assets must be packaged together for delivery. All assets should be delivered in compressed format (e.g. GZIP).
