## What is accessibility

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

> _Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web_

The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

Thus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when websites, web technologies, or web tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web.

It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Indeed, the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/) recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right.

Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as older people, people in rural areas, and people in developing countries.

## Why we care about accessibility

From a technical standpoint, catering for all users complements our browser support policy (we aim to support all browsers), and our use of progressive enhancement.

From a moral standpoint, we have a duty to cater for all users regardless of disability.

From a legal standpoint, we are required to comply with various pieces of equality legislation (e.g. the [2010 Equality Act] and [Section 508] of the US Rehabilitation Act 1973).
