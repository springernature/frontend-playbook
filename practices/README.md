# Practices

Development of products at Springer Nature is informed by two primary constraints:

* The products that Springer Nature produce are used in an enormous variety of contexts, by an enormous variety of users, all of them spread across the planet. We have no way of knowing the situation that any given user could be in. We must deal with:
  * The variety of technical conditions: Device; operating system; network connection; CPU; browser; screen size; interface; institutional network policies; browser extensions; ISP-injected scripts.
  * The infinite variety of the human experience: User context; user disabilities; user time limits; user financial status.
* In order to meet the legal and contractual accessibility obligations of a variety of nation states and large institutional customers we must ensure all of our products adhere to the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, conforming to the “AA” level of Success Criteria .
