# Common remediations

This part of the Playbook describes some common accessibility issues that _can't_ be detected with automated tools, and gives examples and suggestions for repairs. 

It's not exhaustive, and shouldn't be treated as such - these are just some of the mistakes that Accessibility Enablement frequently encounter that you should familiarise yourself with so that you can avoid them in your own work. 

It's also not a substitute for familiarising yourself with WCAG directly.
