## 1. Introduction
[Accessibility Enablement](https://github.com/springernature/accessibility-enablement?tab=readme-ov-file#who-are-we) at [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp) has developed this framework, designed to support and guide accessibility growth across teams and departments. 

This framework helps teams self-assess their current practices, track progress over time, and take confident steps forward on our shared journey towards [accessibility maturity](#2-benefits-of-accessibility-maturity).

### Who it is for
This resource is intended for anyone wishing to enhance accessibility within their department or team. It provides a shared language to assess current practice and identify areas for growth.

### How to use it
Use this framework to:

* Reflect on your team’s current level of accessibility maturity across nine key dimensions, using the [maturity indicators](#3-accessibility-maturity-levels-and-indicators) to identify strengths and areas for improvement.
* Create an [accessibility maturity profile](#4-creating-your-accessibility-maturity-profile) for your team or department, which can be used to inform strategic decisions and investment in accessibility, and track progress over time.
* Foster conversations within and across teams to build a more inclusive and sustainable accessibility culture.

This is not a checklist, but a practical tool to help teams embed accessibility more deeply and consistently in their everyday work.

## 2. Benefits of Accessibility Maturity
A mature approach to accessibility goes beyond technical compliance to deliver inclusive, high-quality user experiences. While meeting the [Web Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) is important, true accessibility maturity embeds accessibility into everyday work, from planning and tools to mindset and collaboration.

Compliance alone doesn’t guarantee usability or user satisfaction, and maturity doesn’t always match compliance levels. Some highly mature teams may still be bringing parts of their service into compliance, while some less mature teams may currently maintain high compliance. 

The key distinction is sustainability: mature teams can achieve and maintain compliance independently, with minimal support, while less mature teams are more likely to regress and require ongoing intervention.

Teams that invest in accessibility maturity are more agile in responding to evolving standards and expectations, proactively meet regulatory requirements, and reduce legal risks. They avoid costly last-minute fixes, strengthen user engagement and loyalty, and deliver better outcomes for all users.

Accessibility maturity also results in more independent customers, better use of team expertise, and stronger digital capabilities for both staff and users. These factors contribute to higher returns on digital investments and more sustainable, inclusive products and services, delivered by default, not by exception.

Organisational benefits grow with maturity and include, but are not limited to: increased user engagement and loyalty, improved user outcomes, greater consumer independence, more effective use of support staff skills, higher ROI, and enhanced digital capability across the organisation.

Table 1 below outlines how these benefits align with the four levels of accessibility maturity developed for teams and departments across [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp).


**TABLE 1. Benefits of accessibility maturity**

|         Maturity levels:         | **Emerging** | **Developing** | **Established** | **Transformative** |
|------------------------|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|
| **Typical Quote**      | _“Please let us know if we need to do any work around accessibility”_ | _“We aim to comply with web standards”_ | _“We aim to maximise user independence and minimise barriers”_ | _“Disability is the first thing we discuss at all points of product development”_ |
| **Legal Risk**         |High|Medium|Low|Very low|
| **Benefits for Users** |Very low|Medium|High|Very high|
| **Benefits to Organisation** |Very low|Medium|High|Very high|



## 3. Accessibility Maturity Levels and Indicators
Each team or department can assess its **accessibility maturity** using four defined **levels**, helping them understand their current position and identify opportunities for growth:

* **Emerging.** Accessibility is minimal or absent. Awareness is low, and actions are ad hoc or externally driven.
* **Developing.** Accessibility is acknowledged, often in response to compliance needs, but practices are inconsistent.
* **Established.** Accessibility is built into workflows. Teams follow standards and are becoming proactive.
* **Transformative.** Accessibility is fully integrated into strategy and culture. Teams lead by example and continuously innovate.

To support meaningful use of these levels, the framework identifies **nine dimensions of accessibility maturity**. These dimensions reflect key aspects of teams’ operations and culture: _motivation, user voice, compliance, leadership and culture, people and capabilities, support and resources, processes, hiring, and procurement_.

Each dimension comes with a set of **indicators** that describe what the four maturity levels look like in practice. By comparing your team’s current approach with these indicators, you can identify the maturity level for each dimension, understand your current position, and see what progress could look like.

Table 2 below outlines the nine dimensions of accessibility maturity, highlighting the **indicators** that show what each maturity level looks like in practice.


**TABLE 2. Accessibility Maturity Indicators**

|       Dimension        | **Emerging** | **Developing** | **Established** | **Transformative** |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **1.Motivation**         |Only respond to external pressure (e.g., legal risk).|Reactive, compliance-focused only.|Compliance and quality driven, but not proactively.|Proactive; internalised motivation; accessibility seen as strategic value. Constant improvement.|
| **2.User voice**         |Tokenistic; little or no involvement of disabled users.|Consulted sporadically, often post-design.|Consulted frequently; some champions push for deeper inclusion.|Active partnership with disabled users; co-design embedded.|
| **3.Compliance**         |Bare minimum, usually late in process.|Compliance is the main goal; implemented inconsistently.|Compliance and quality are aligned; standards inform late-stage decisions.|Compliance seen as a baseline; experience prioritised through continuous review and improvement.|
| **4.Culture and Leadership**        |Accessibility not considered in priorities.|Some interest, but it’s not integral to leadership or strategy.|Support exists, but not across all roles or activities.|Top-down leadership drives accessibility; integrated into strategic priorities.|
| **5.People and Capability**         |One or two advocates; no formal upskilling or support.|Passive training uptake; ad hoc skill development.|Training and resources available; some embedded practices.|Upskilling is routine; teams seek support, mentoring, and external expertise as part of continuous learning.|
| **6.Support and Resources**         |No budget or dedicated support.|Use enablement teams only when directed.|Some resource planning; reactive rather than strategic.|Budgeting is routine; support proactively sought and integrated in planning cycles.|
| **7.Processes**         |Accessibility introduced only when problems arise.|Implemented post-design; creates friction and inefficiencies.|Integrated late in the development lifecycle.|Accessibility considered from ideation through delivery; integrated into agile/dev cycles with accountability structures (RAG status, steering groups).|
| **8.Hiring and Roles**         |Accessibility not considered in recruitment.|Only seen as relevant for UX/Frontend.|Some hiring includes accessibility as a bonus.|Accessibility competencies considered across roles; job specs reflect this.|
| **9.Procurement**         |Accessibility is not considered during procurement. Suppliers are selected without any accessibility requirements or evaluation.|Accessibility requirements may be mentioned, but are not enforced. Supplier claims are taken at face value; little follow-up or validation.|Accessibility is part of procurement checklists. Suppliers are asked for WCAG conformance or VPATs. Some validation takes place, but not always consistently.|Accessibility is a core procurement criterion. Suppliers are assessed on outcomes, not just claims. Contracts include accessibility clauses, with ongoing monitoring.|


## 4. Creating Your Accessibility Maturity Profile
The purpose of this framework is not to label teams as “_good_” or “_bad_,” but to help you understand your current position and plan realistic, achievable next steps.

Begin with a **self-assessment**: Review all nine dimensions and use the indicators for each to assess your team’s current practice. The maturity level you reach shows your current position. Once you’ve assessed every dimension, you’ll have an _Accessibility Maturity Profile_, a clear, practical snapshot of how accessibility is embedded in your team’s work.

Use your profile to **prioritise efforts**: focus on the dimensions where improvement will have the greatest impact. Then, **track progress** by revisiting your profile regularly to measure growth and celebrate achievements.

A _mixed_ profile is expected. Different aspects of your work may mature at different rates depending on priorities, resources, and structures. This variation can be a strength: it highlights opportunities for cross-team learning, targeted support, or focused investment. It can reveal where a small change could have a big impact, or where strong practices could be shared more widely.

The aim is meaningful reflection and continuous progress, not _perfection_. Over time, your maturity profile can guide strategic decisions, strengthen collaboration, and embed accessibility more deeply into your team’s culture.


## 5. Common Challenges
No team starts out perfect, and most encounter similar barriers on the road to accessibility maturity. Recognising these challenges is the first step to overcoming them. Here are some of the most common:

* **Low awareness or confidence:** not knowing where to start
* **Lack of ownership:** accessibility seen as someone else’s responsibility
* **No user voice:** a strong focus on compliance and checklists
* **Limited resources:** limited time, funding, tools or skills

The good news? These are all solvable. The indicators help teams uncover which barriers to address first. You’re not expected to solve everything at once. The goal is steady, informed progress, and support is available every step of the way.
