## 1. Introduction
[Accessibility Enablement](https://github.com/springernature/accessibility-enablement?tab=readme-ov-file#who-are-we) has developed this framework, designed to support and guide accessibility growth across teams and departments. This framework helps teams self-assess their current practices, track progress over time, and take confident steps forward on our shared journey towards accessibility maturity.
### Who it is for
This resource is intended for anyone wishing to enhance accessibility within their department or team. It provides a shared language to assess current practice and identify areas for growth.
### How to use it
Use this framework to:
* Reflect on your team’s current level of accessibility maturity across nine key dimensions, and identify strengths and areas for improvement.
* Create an accessibility maturity profile for your team or department, which can be used to inform strategic decisions and investment in accessibility, and track progress over time.
* Foster conversations within and across teams to build a more inclusive and sustainable accessibility culture.

This is not a checklist, but a practical tool to help teams embed accessibility more deeply and consistently in their everyday work.

## 2. What is accessibility maturity?
A mature approach to accessibility goes beyond technical requirements to focus on inclusive, high-quality user experiences. Your website or platform can meet the standards outlined in the [Web Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) and still fall short in terms of usability and satisfaction. 

Some highly mature teams may still have services working toward compliance, while some less mature teams may currently maintain high compliance. That’s why accessibility needs to be built into everyday work, from planning and tools to mindset and collaboration. It's important to recognise that team accessibility maturity does not always correlate directly with compliance levels. 

The key distinction is sustainability: mature teams are more likely to achieve and maintain compliance independently, with minimal support. In contrast, less mature teams are at higher risk of compliance regressions and require ongoing support to stay compliant.

## 3. What are the benefits?
Teams that develop mature accessibility practices are more agile in responding to changing standards and expectations, and they reduce legal risks by proactively meeting regulatory requirements. They experience fewer last-minute fixes, stronger user engagement and loyalty, and better outcomes for all users. 
Accessibility maturity also leads to more independent customers, better use of team expertise, and enhanced digital capabilities across both teams and users. These factors contribute to better returns on digital investments and more sustainable, inclusive products and services delivered by default, not by exception.
Investing in accessibility maturity is a cost-effective strategy that embeds accessibility into the organisation's culture and long-term success.
A core aim of Accessibility Enablement is to raise the accessibility maturity of all teams. By doing so, we embed accessibility into the organisation’s culture, making these efforts self-sustaining over time. ​​Table 1. below outlines how these benefits align with [the four levels of accessibility maturity[(https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DOWev3ocaGoftALeUX-3ru8z9aFL6h1A_eGxBoIxNs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.29k76t7dh0xd) developed for teams and departments across Springer Nature.
## 4. Maturity levels and dimensions
Each team or department can assess its accessibility maturity using four defined levels, helping them understand their current position and identify opportunities for growth:
Emerging. Accessibility is minimal or absent. Awareness is low, and actions are ad hoc or externally driven.
Developing. Accessibility is acknowledged, often in response to compliance needs, but practices are inconsistent.
Established. Accessibility is built into workflows. Teams follow standards and are becoming proactive.
Transformative. Accessibility is fully integrated into strategy and culture. Teams lead by example and continuously innovate.
To support meaningful use of these levels, the framework identifies nine dimensions of accessibility maturity. These dimensions reflect key aspects of teams’ operations and culture: motivation, user voice, compliance, leadership and culture, people and capabilities, support and resources, processes, hiring, and procurement.
Each dimension can be assessed against the four levels, helping teams understand where they are now and what progress might look like.
It’s expected that teams will be at different levels across the dimensions. The aim isn’t to be perfect, it’s to understand your team’s current state, create an accessibility maturity profile, and plan realistic next steps.

Table 2. below outlines the nine dimensions of accessibility maturity, with indicators that illustrate what each level of maturity looks like in practice.


## 5. How to use the Indicators?
This framework isn’t about rating teams as “good” or “bad”, it’s to understand where you are, and plan realistic next steps. It’s designed to help you and your team:
Self-assess: Reflect on each dimension and select the maturity level that best fits.
Facilitate team discussions: Use it in retrospectives or planning sessions.
Prioritise efforts: Focus on dimensions with the most impact.
Track progress: Revisit regularly to measure growth and celebrate wins.
Again, this isn’t about scoring teams, or being “perfect”. It’s about meaningful reflection and continuous progress.

## 6. How to interpret the results?
The maturity level you identify in each dimension offers insight into how accessibility is embedded within your team’s practices. 
This is your accessibility maturity profile. A mixed profile is expected as different aspects of your work may mature at different rates, depending on priorities, resources, and team structures. Use this variation to spark meaningful conversations, not comparisons.

Rather than aiming for uniformity, use your maturity profile to identify opportunities for cross-team learning, targeted support, or focused investment. It can reveal where a small change could have a big impact, or where strong practices can be shared across departments.

## 7. Common challenges
No team starts out perfect, and most encounter similar barriers on the road to accessibility maturity. Recognising these challenges is the first step to overcoming them.
Here are some of the most common:
Low awareness or confidence: not knowing where to start
Lack of ownership: accessibility seen as someone else’s responsibility
No user voice: a strong focus on compliance and checklists
Limited resources: limited time, funding, tools or skills
The good news? These are all solvable. The indicators help teams uncover which barriers to address first. You’re not expected to solve everything at once. The goal is steady, informed progress, and support is available every step of the way.

## 8. We are here to support you
The Accessibility Enablement team is here to help you get the most from this framework. We offer:
Support with self-assessment
Help identifying practical next steps
Guidance on setting goals across dimensions
We’re also developing guidance on involving disabled users in design, testing, and co-creation, an essential component of achieving accessibility maturity.
