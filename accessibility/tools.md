## Automated testing

Automated accessibility testing can be used to detect the most common accessibility problems. This is only the first step in the process; you MUST NOT rely on automated testing as your sole method of verification! 

The GDS Accessibility team ran an experiment in 2017 to [audit the performance of a large number of available automated accessibility testing tools](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/). They found that the highest number of errors that one tool was able to detect was 40%. The majority of the tools fell into the 20%-30% range.
