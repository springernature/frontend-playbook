# Security

This section intends to provide frontend developers with a basic primer in security principles and technologies; relating to both pure client-side technologies, and technologies that serve client-side code.

It's split into several parts, and designed to be read in order:

 - [Frontend security risk](./01-frontend-security-risk.md) 
 - [Fundamental security principles](./02-fundamental-security-principles.md) 
 - [Frontend security examples](./03-frontend-security-examples.md)
 - [Frontend security technologies](./03-frontend-security-examples.md)
