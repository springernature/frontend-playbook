# Security

All web developers should be aware of security risks related to web technologies.

* The Open Worldwide Application Security Project ([OWASP](https://owasp.org/)) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. They maintain a [top 10 list of critical security risks in web applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), which is essential reading.
* Mozilla's open-source infosec documentation contains an excellent [Web Security cheat sheet](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security.html) we encourage you to read.
* We also publish a document intending to help you create [secure markup](secure-markup.md).
