# Frontend security risk

Unless building an ecommerce site, it's a common misconception that "hackers are not interested in my product". **This is not true.**  If you have a web server connected to the internet, you have resources someone will want to abuse.

All public web applications are under constant automated attack; from those looking to steal server resources to conduct blackhat SEO, mine cryptocurrencies, distribute malware, send spam, etc.

_Your site is definitely at risk._

Another common misconception is that security doesn't matter much for frontend technologies, and that security is a job just for backend developers and network engineers. **This is not true.**

Client-side technologies can be misused to:
 - distribute malware.
 - steal sessions and impersonate users.
 - steal payment information.
 - deface pages causing reputational and SEO harm.
 - act as viruses/worms to DDoS victim servers, DDoS other servers...
 - exploit a security hole in one web site to attack a different web site under the same main domain.
 - automate form submissions for users.
 - crash users browsers.
 - "and more"

## This is terrible! What can we do?

Yes, this *is* terrible. The internet was originally designed to be robust, not secure; but web standards have evolved to meet increasing security threats, and we will look at some of these standards.

The good news is, by following some basic security principles and using some standardised technologies we can go a long way towards making our web sites safer for our users and our organisation.
